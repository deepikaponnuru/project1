    <p>In the Kingdom of Cloister, farm boy Jack is fascinated by the legend of Erik, an ancient king who defeated an army of invading giants from a realm in the sky controlling them with a magical crown. Simultaneously, Princess Isabelle is fascinated with the same legend.</p>
    <p>Ten years later, Jack sells a horse in town for his uncle. There, Jack defends Isabelle's honor from a group of hooligans, becoming enamored with her. Meanwhile, Lord Roderick discovers a monk has robbed him of magic beans, who offers them to Jack as collateral for his horse.</p>
    <p>Back at the castle, Isabelle quarrels with her father King Brahmwell as she wants to explore the kingdom, but he wants her to stay and marry Roderick. Likewise, Jack's uncle scolds him for being foolish before throwing the beans to the floor and leaving.Determined to be free, Isabelle sneaks out of the castle, seeking shelter from the rain at Jack's. As it rains, one of the beans takes root and grows into a massive beanstalk that carries the house and Isabelle into the sky as Jack falls to the ground.</p>
    <img src="https://weminoredinfilm.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/jackgiant.jpg?w=300" style="float:left" height="20%" width="20%"/><p> Jack, Roderick, and Roderick's attendant Wicke join six of the king's knights, led by Elmont and his second-in-command, Crawe, climbing the beanstalk in search of Isabelle. 
                As they climb, a lightning storm during the night knocks five knights from the beanstalk, and Roderick and Wicke cut the safety rope, intentionally sending them to their deaths - the two claim the rope snapped.</p>
    <p>At the top, they discover the giants' realm and split into two groups: one with Jack, Elmont, and Crawe, and the other including Roderick, Wicke, and the remaining knight. Before the groups part ways, Roderick corners Jack and secretly takes the remaining beans he has, threatening death if he tells anyone (although Jack manages to save one).<br><br>Jack's group is trapped by a giant, who takes Elmont and Crawe prisoner while Jack, his scent hidden underwater, escapes. Meanwhile, Roderick tricks the knight close to the ledge and pushes him to his death, but then immediately encounters two other giants; one eats Wicke, but Roderick dons the magical crown before meeting the same fate.</p>
    <p>Jack follows the giant to their stronghold, where the two-headed giant leader, Fallon, earlier devoured the defiant Crawe and he finds Isabelle and Elmont imprisoned. Fallon reveals to Isabelle's surprise that she is King Erik's descendant as he can smell his blood within her. As the giants prepare to kill the prisoners, Roderick walks in and enslaves them with the crown. He tells the giants they will attack Cloister at dawn and gives them permission to eat Isabelle and Elmont.</p>

<p>One of the giants prepares to cook Elmont as a pig-in-a-blanket and is about to chop Isabelle up when Jack impales his neck with a kitchen knife from above. The trio races to the beanstalk, where Jack causes the giant guarding it to fall off the realm's edge. Seeing the giant's body, Brahmwell orders the beanstalk cut down to avoid a giant invasion, putting the safety of the Earth ahead of Isabelle's possible return.</p>
<p>Jack and Isabelle head down the beanstalk, during which they admit their growing feelings, while Elmont stays to confront Roderick. He kills him, but Fallon takes the crown before he can, so he is forced to escape down the falling beanstalk or be trapped in the giants' realm. Fallon dons the crown as a ring, becoming King of the Giants. Jack, Isabelle, and Elmont all survive the fall after the beanstalk is cut down. As everyone returns home, Jack warns them the giants used Roderick's beans to create beanstalks to descend down to attack Cloister.
<p>The giants chase Jack, Isabelle, and Brahmwell into the castle, where Elmont fills the moat with oil and lights it. Fallon falls into the moat and breaks into the throne room from below. As the siege continues and both sides struggle for control of the drawbridge, Fallon captures Jack and Isabelle, but Jack throws the final bean down Fallon's throat before he can eat him, causing a beanstalk to rip apart his body. Jack takes the crown: just as the giants break into the courtyard, he takes control of them, sending them back to their realm to cut down the beanstalks themselves.</p>
<p>Brahmwell abolishes the law that the princess can't be with a commoner, so Jack and Isabelle marry and tell the story of the giants to their children. As time passes, the magic crown is crafted into St Edward's Crown and is secured in the Tower of London while the giants' realm is shown to still exist above London in the modern day.</p>
